## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>

What is the current problem?

Biologicals are naturally derived products that can support crop health and sustainability outcomes. In the face of new threats to crops from changing climates, biological products can help to protect yields, improve soil health and enable farmers to continue to feed a growing population. However, a lack of understanding and data access on biological efficacy across various climates, soil types and conditions mean that many farmers are unable to make the best product selection for their field or crop, leading to suboptimal yields and worse outcomes in the face of environmental challenges.

What is the expected final product?

An AI-enabled solution designed to support farmers in: 
(i) visualizing the climate, soil and disease risks facing them and implications for their crop; 
(ii) recommending the best fit biological products for their crop, soil types and field conditions and when to apply them; 
(iii) track outcomes during the season and use the data to improve recommendations for the subsequent year.

The solution can take various forms: an app, website

Who are the users of this solution?

Primary users will be farmers in India and Brazil. The teams are free to choose one of the locations of the farmer.  

Optionally: Farmers, ag retailers, agronomists etc. in ‘expert mode’

## <p align="center"> Further Information: </p>

Syngenta will provide access to data from real commercial farms, access to satellite imagery, weather and environmental datasets, and pest and disease models. A description of each dataset/API and how to use it will be provided in the Github folder.  

Hackers will have to API access to three Syngenta platforms: 
- CE Hub: a data lake for crop and environmental datasets 
- Product card: access to a variety of products
- Algortihms:  

Hackers are invited to use programming software such as Python and any other tools at their disposal to tackle the case  

Participants are welcome to use any other publicly available datasets    


##  <p align="center"> Resources: </p>
Below is an overview of the tools that you may use during the hack:

- **CE-Hub**: Provides a central access point for environmental data associated with time and geographical coordinates. Through well-defined APIs, it is possible to obtain historical weather data, vegetation health information, soil characteristics, land use, and topography.​ [Documentation](https://github.com/syngenta/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024/blob/main/docs/api/ce%20hub/CEHub%20API%20Service%20Specification.docx), [API Postman Collection](https://github.com/syngenta/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024/blob/main/docs/api/ce%20hub/CE%20Hub%20API's.postman_collection.json), [Swagger API Documentation](https://services.cehub.syngenta-ais.com/swagger/index.html) and [Video Tutorial](https://github.com/syngenta/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024/blob/main/docs/api/ce%20hub/GMT20240319-133726_Recording_1920x1080.mp4)





## <p align="center"> Judging Criteria: </p>
Judgment criteria are important for the participants to understand the focus of the case. You could either focus more on the technical aspect (coding and programming), on the business aspect (product fitting in the market), or it can be both. Please also add the weighted criteria. Scoring 1 to 5 (5 best) for each category.
