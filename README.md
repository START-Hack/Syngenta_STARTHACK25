Syngenta will provide access to data from real commercial farms, access to satellite imagery, weather and environmental datasets, and pest and disease models. A description of each dataset/API and how to use it will be provided in the Github folder.  

Hackers will have to API access to three Syngenta platforms: 
- CE Hub: a data lake for crop and environmental datasets 
- Product card: access to a variety of products
- Algortihms:  

Hackers are invited to use programming software such as Python and any other tools at their disposal to tackle the case  

Participants are welcome to use any other publicly available datasets

Below is an overview of the tools that you may use during the hack:

- **CE-Hub**: Provides a central access point for environmental data associated with time and geographical coordinates. Through well-defined APIs, it is possible to obtain historical weather data, vegetation health information, soil characteristics, land use, and topography.​ [Documentation](https://github.com/syngenta/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024/blob/main/docs/api/ce%20hub/CEHub%20API%20Service%20Specification.docx), [API Postman Collection](https://github.com/syngenta/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024/blob/main/docs/api/ce%20hub/CE%20Hub%20API's.postman_collection.json), [Swagger API Documentation](https://services.cehub.syngenta-ais.com/swagger/index.html) and [Video Tutorial](https://github.com/syngenta/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024/blob/main/docs/api/ce%20hub/GMT20240319-133726_Recording_1920x1080.mp4)


You are also welcome to use any other public dataset that consider relevant for the success of your project. 

7. Our main documentation hub is located at [Cropwise Hackathon Guide](https://syngenta.github.io/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024/guide.html). On this landing page, you’ll get access to the [API documentation](https://github.com/syngenta/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024), as well as direct links to the [Cropwise Imagery application](https://imagery.cropwise.com/). Additionally, the guide elaborates on various image analysis tools at your disposal. We highly recommend familiarizing yourself with these materials to maximize your readiness for the hackathon.
